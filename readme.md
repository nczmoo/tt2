SUMMARY

TODO
    X Make a 10x10 grid where each space has a rank of 1-5 in money, conflict 
        and heat. The average of all spaces should be 3. (the average seems like basic   math in hindsight)
    x Switch to boards to equal drug fiends. (satiated / non-satiated)
    x Setup trap house and set up on corners. (not able to build trap houses yet)
    x Have cop wander. (should they follow satiated fiends?)
    x Have fiends migrate to buy drugs. Each space away is a lower chance they'll migrate. Satiated fiends wander aimlessly.
    x instead of wandering completely randomly, police go to highest addict space or random if all equal
    x if next to a dealer with product, they will arrest them
    x move traphouse to center
    x dealer can be upgraded
    x buy more dealers
    x upgrade runner
    x buy more runners
    x before a dealer is deleted, go get the product (instead wait until product is sold out)
    x if a cop lands on a runner, chance to get arrested
    x prevent people from placing a dealer within x spaces of traphouse    
    x cop goes in a random direction (orthogonal) and only moves ever <x> seconds
    x when cop hits boundary, they turn clock wise.
    x PROBLEM: cop just goes along the edge now.
    heat is distributed around drug dealing areas and cops will follow heat
    price of brick should change

DESIGN
    
    Nothing to really mitigate the cop other tahn moving it

MAYBE
    have varying prices on the space
