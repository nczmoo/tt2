SUMMARY

TODO
    X Make a 10x10 grid where each space has a rank of 1-5 in money, conflict 
        and heat. The average of all spaces should be 3. (the average seems like basic   math in hindsight)
    x Switch to boards to equal drug fiends. (satiated / non-satiated)
    x Setup trap house and set up on corners. (not able to build trap houses yet)
    x Have cop wander. (should they follow satiated fiends?)
    x Have fiends migrate to buy drugs. Each space away is a lower chance they'll migrate. Satiated fiends wander aimlessly.
    x instead of wandering completely randomly, police go to highest addict space or random if all equal
    x if next to a dealer with product, they will arrest them
    x move traphouse to center
    x dealer can be upgraded
    x buy more dealers
    x upgrade runner
    x buy more runners
    x before a dealer is deleted, go get the product (instead wait until product is sold out)
    if a cop lands on a runner, chance to get arrested
    prevent people from placing a dealer within x spaces of traphouse

DESIGN
    
    Nothing to really mitigate the cop other tahn moving it

MAYBE
    have varying prices on the space
