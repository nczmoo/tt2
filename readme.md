SUMMARY

TODO
    X Make a 10x10 grid where each space has a rank of 1-5 in money, conflict 
        and heat. The average of all spaces should be 3. (the average seems like basic   math in hindsight)
    x Switch to boards to equal drug fiends. (satiated / non-satiated)
    x Setup trap house and set up on corners. (not able to build trap houses yet)
    x Have cop wander. (should they follow satiated fiends?)
    x Have fiends migrate to buy drugs. Each space away is a lower chance they'll migrate. Satiated fiends wander aimlessly.
    x instead of wandering completely randomly, police go to highest addict space or random if all equal
    if next to a dealer with product, they will arrest them
    move traphouse to center
    dealer can be upgraded
    buy more dealers
    upgrade runner
    buy more runners
